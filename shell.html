Ingredients:
               <br> <br>
 2 1/2 teaspoons (10 grams) of dry yeast
               <br>
 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of warm water
               <br>
 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of evaporated milk
               <br>
 3/8 cup (75 grams) of refined sugar
               <br>
1 teaspoon salt
<br> <br>
1/3 cup (75 grams) of melted butter
               <br>
 1 egg
               <br>
 4 cups (500 grams) of wheat flour
               <br>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
               <br> <br>

               <br> <br>
Preparation:
<br> <br>
Dissolve the yeast in the water in a large bowl. Add the evaporated milk, 3/8 cup of sugar, 1/3 cup of butter, salt, egg and 2 cups of flour; mix with a spatula. Gradually add the 2 cups of remaining flour and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Place on a floured surface and knead only until a dough forms.
               <br> <br>
                Knead for 6 to 8 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place inside a bowl greased with oil and move the dough inside it so that it is covered with oil. Cover with a towel and let it rest in a warm place so that it doubles its size, approximately 1 hour.
               <br> <br>
               Meanwhile, prepare the shell cover. Beat in a bowl 2/3 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of butter, until acremar. Add the flour and continue beating until it forms a thick paste. Divide the pasta into 2 portions and place each one in a separate bowl. Mix the cinnamon with one portion and the vanilla with the other.
<br> <br>
 When the dough has doubled its volume, cut it into 12 pieces of the same size. Form balls and arrange them in a greased tray, 8 centimeters apart.
<br> <br>
 Now take the cinnamon flavor paste and divide it into 6 balls. Flatten each ball with your hands and place on a ball of dough, pressing gently to flatten the dough a little. Repeat the procedure with the vanilla flavor paste and the rest of the dough balls. With the help of a knife, mark lines similar to those of seashells. Cover and let them double their volume for approximately 45 minutes.
