           <h2>Pineapple jams</h2>
           <hr font color="red">
            <center>
Ingredients:
               <br> <br>
1 pineapple
               <br> <br>
1 cup (240 ml) of water
               <br> <br>
5 cups (1kg) of granulated sugar
               <br> <br>
2 lemons
               <br> <br>
1 pack of pectin
            

<br> <br>
Preparation:
<br> <br>

Remove the pineapple peel. Before cutting it, rinse it in the laundry room. Then, peel it by placing it on its side and cutting off the top and bottom. Then, place it vertically and cut the outer skin into strips.
<br> <br> <br>
 Cut the pineapple into small pieces. Cut the pineapple into small cubes of 3 cm (1 inch). It is not necessary that you be precise, since you will liquefy it. Just make sure the pieces are small enough to be placed in the food processor or the blender.
               <br> <br>
 Sprinkle the pieces of pineapple. Put them in a blender or food processor. Then, liquefy the pineapple until it reaches a smooth and a little pulpy consistency. [3] Remove any seeds or thick pieces of the mixture.
               <br> <br>
Squeeze the lemon juice. Wash the two lemons and cut them in half. Squeeze the lemon juice (by hand or using a juicer) into the pineapple mixture. Then, stir it with a spoon.
               <br> <br>
 Mix the sugar. Pour the five cups of sugar into the pineapple mixture. Stir it well so that the sugar is fully incorporated into the pineapple and dissolves. Then, let the mixture settle for about fifteen minutes
               <br> <br>
Herve the pectin and water in a saucepan. Combine a pack of pectin with one cup (240 ml) of water in a small saucepan. Then, boil the mixture over medium heat for one minute and remove the pan from the stove. [5]
Pectin is an extract of fruits that thickens jams and jellies.
Different varieties of pectin sometimes require you to add different amounts of water. Check and follow the package instructions in case you should use a different amount of water instead of a cup.
               <br> <br>

Combine the pectin with the pineapple mixture. Pour the pectin into the pineapple mixture and stir for one minute. You will notice how the mixture thickens considerably and acquires a texture more similar to the jam compared to what it looked like before
