Ingredients:
               <br> <br>
 1/3 cup of water
               <br>
 1 package of baking yeast
               <br>
1 spoon of sugar
               <br>
 1 tablespoon of salt
               <br>
1 1/3 cups of milk at a time
<br> <br>
3 1/2 cups flour
               <br>
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil
               <br>
          1 piece of egg
               <br>
 2 tablespoons of cream
               <br> <br>
               <hr font color = "red">
               <br> <br>
Preparation: <br> <br>
In a small bowl, mix the water, the yeast and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let stand for 5 minutes and make sure the yeast is reacting.
<br>
In another small deep bowl, dissolve the rest of the sugar and salt in the milk.
<br>
In a bowl the flour, the milk, the water with yeast and the oil have been added and the mixture with a wooden spatula.
<br>
On a surface with flour put the dough and the battery with the hands changing side each time for 2-3 minutes.
<br>
Transfer the dough to a container, cover with plastic wrap and let it grow for about an hour and a half. The dough should double in size.
<br>
Re-knead the dough on a surface with flour for 2-3 minutes and put in a refractory and cover with plastic wrap. Scroll up to 45 minutes in the refrigerator for the entire night.
<br>
On a surface with flour click on a butter base with a wooden spatula. This base should be 3/4 the size of the flattened dough.
<br>
On another surface is the dough with a baking roll. Put the butter on the dough and knead it to incorporate it 100%. Make a dough ball and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
<br>
Remove the dough from the refrigerator and the roller in a way of approximately 50 by 24 cms. If the butter is hard while it is melting.
<br><br>            
Cut the rectangle in half and in each half make triangles, each triangle will be a horn.
               <br>
               Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius and roll each triangle towards the tip
               <br>
               Put the little horns on baking trays with waxed paper underneath them and curl the edges of each little horn towards the center.
               <br>
               In a bowl whisk the egg yolk and the cream and with a brush paint the horns so that they take a golden color.
               <br>
               Cook the horns for 15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven.
