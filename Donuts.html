Ingredients:
               <br> <br>
 500 gr. Flour 0000
               <br>
 15 gr. Dry yeast or 30 gr. Fresh yeast
               <br>
 1/2 cup (120 milliliters) of evaporated milk
               <br>
 100 ml. Milk
               <br>
2 Eggs
<br> <br>
100 gr. Sugar
               <br>
100 gr. Butter / butter
               <br>
1 tsp Salt
               <br> <br>
               <hr font color = "red">
               <br> <br>
Preparation:
<br> <br>
 Add to the warm milk, the yeast, two tablespoons of flour and a spoonful of sugar. We take out all of the same ingredients. Stir it and leave a few minutes until the yeast is activated.
<br> <br>
 In a bowl place the flour and add the rest of the sugar in the center, and the yeast activated with the warm milk, sprinkle the salt at the ends so that it does not mix directly with the yeast. Add the eggs and integrate all the ingredients.
<br> <br>
 Knead for a few minutes, then add the butter, knead and hit the dough on the counter until the butter is completely integrated and the dough returns to take shape (do not add flour).
<br> <br>
 Bollar and let rise until doubling its volume, paint with oil the dough so that it does not dry out and cover with a repasador or with paper film. Leave in a warm place.
<br> <br>
 Once the volume of the dough is doubled, degas and stretch with a stick leaving a height of 1 cm. Approximately.
               <br> <br>
 Using a cutter for donuts, or with a glass and another round cutter smaller make the hole in the center.
               <br> <br>
 Form the donuts and place them in a tray with butter paper separated from each other, let rise again until the volume is doubled.
               <br> <br>
 Fry the donuts on both sides in plenty of oil at a temperature of 160 degrees. Decorate to taste, it can be with sugar, chocolate, colored granas, icing sugar icing or you can also fill it with dulce de leche or custard.
